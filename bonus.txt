Visual simulation
=================

Written in python3 and can be found in src/simulate.py.
Receives both input file as output file (previously created by myrobot) as inputs.
To run it, enter the following command: python3 src/simulate.py <inputfile> <outputfile>.
FPS can also be adjusted using the --fps flag.

Automatic testing
=================

Written in C++ using the GTest framework.
Contains both system and unit tests, with fixtures, mocking, and extra infrastructure as needed.
To run the tests, run the following commands from the root dir of the project:
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DBUILD_TESTS=ON
ctest

More details about testing and validation can be found in the HLD file.

Logging system
==============

Besides the required output file generated by`myrobot`, we've developed a more shopisticated and robust logging system.
We created a general `Logger` singleton base class to accommodate future possible logging needs.
Additionaly, we implemented a `RobotLogger` derived class to adapt the `Logger` API to our specific usecases.
Our logging system supports multiple logging levels (INFO, WARNING, ERROR) to enhance log messages.
It also allows for logging to different files or the console.

Using a singleton design pattern offers several benefits:
1) Single logger instance ensures thread safety and prevents resource access races.
2) Simplifies usage by eliminating the need to pass the logger through function calls or reconfigure multiple instances.

Interesting implementation details
==================================

Position hashing function
-------------------------

Simply put, Position is a pair of integers (coordiantes) which represent a place in the house.
In our implementation, we use unordered collections of Position objects.
To do so, we must implement a hashing function, and we chose elegant pairing which is injective
and has a few more desired properties.
More information about it can be found in: src/position.h+63
