# Vacuum
## Quick Start
* Clone this repository.
* Build the project:
  ```
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake ..
  make
  ```
* Run it:
  ```
  ./myrobot <inputfile>
  ```
  * Example input and output files can be found in `examples`, `tests`, and `tests/inputs`.

## Solution Approach
The house is a 4-connected grid, where each node contains either a wall, an empty space (with a predefined amount of dirt) or a docking station. <br>
In the solution there are several components, each represented by a designated class. <br>
The `Simulator` class is the main class of the project. It creates a `House` and a `Battery` which together represent the true state of the simulation at any given time. <br>
The `House` and `Battery` together implement the `DirtSensor`, `WallsSensor`, and `BatteryMeter` interfaces, which allow getting the state of the simulation without mutating it. <br>
The `Algorithm` implements the navgiation algorithm, and uses information from all sensors to make its decisions. <br>
Our chosen algorithm relies heavely on finding the shortest route from the current destionation to a designated target - unvisited or dirty positions. <br>
More information can be found in the HLD document.

## Inputs and Outputs
### Input File
The input format is as follows:
```
<name>
MaxSteps = <value>
MaxBattery = <value>
Rows = <value>
Cols = <value>
<map>
```

The `name` is a string, while all `value`s are numbers.

The map is a jagged array of characters, following the legend below:
```
D	docking station
W	wall (non-navigable position)
[space]	empty (navigable) position with dirt level of 0
0	empty position with dirt level of 0, same as [space]
â‹®
9	empty position with dirt level of 9
```

### Output File
The output file format is:
```
NumSteps = <NUMBER>
DirtLeft = <NUMBER>
Status = <WORKING/FINISHED/DEAD>
InDock = <TRUE/FALSE>
Score = <NUMBER>
Steps:
<values>
```

The `Steps` attribute is a list of steps where each steps is either *N*orth, *E*ast, *S*outh, *W*est, *s*tay, or *F*inished, denoted as N, E, S, W, s, or F respectively.
